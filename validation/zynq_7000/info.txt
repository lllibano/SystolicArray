The 'ooc' directory contains source/constraint files for an 8x8 systolic array, and a 'tcl.tcl' script that allows for OOC sythesis, placement and routing in Vivado's non-project mode.

The 'system' directory contains 'systolic_8x8_ip' and 'systolic_8x8_system'.
The 'systolic_8x8_ip' directory is the root of a Vivado project for an 8x8 systolic array IP.
The 'systolic_8x8_system' includes 'systolic_8x8_ip' in it's IP catalog, and instantiates it in a block design along with a Zynq PS, an AXI DMA, and some other auxiliary blocks. An application is written inside SDK to demonstrate an use-case of 'systolic_8x8_ip', where input data is sent by the PS to the PL (via DMA), and output data is sent by the PL to the PS (via DMA).
