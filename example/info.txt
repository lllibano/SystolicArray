The 'systolic_2x2_ip' directory is the root of an example Vivado project for a 2x2 systolic array.
The source files were generated by the scripts in 'generator'.
The project also includes naive testbenches for 'array.sv' and 'top.sv', along with their respective '*.wfcg' files.

The 'systolic_2x2_system.zip' file contains a directory that is the root of an example Vivado project.
It includes 'systolic_2x2_ip' in it's IP catalog, and instantiates it in a block design along with a Zynq PS, an AXI DMA, and some other auxiliary blocks. An application is written inside SDK to demonstrate an use-case of 'systolic_2x2_ip', where input data is sent by the PS to the PL (via DMA), and output data is sent by the PL to the PS (via DMA).
